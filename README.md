# CIFAR-10 CNN Classification

Welcome to my project on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)! In this repository, I’ve built a model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which is a popular dataset in the world of computer vision.

## About the Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 color images, each 32x32 pixels, categorized into 10 different classes. The classes are:
1. Airplane
2. Automobile
3. Bird
4. Cat
5. Deer
6. Dog
7. Frog
8. Horse
9. Ship
10. Truck

The dataset is split into 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. Each image is labeled with one of the ten classes, making it a great challenge for practicing image classification.

## How the Model Works

I designed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically learn and identify features from the images. Here’s a breakdown of the architecture:

- **Convolutional Layers**: I used three convolutional layers to extract features like edges and textures from the images. Each of these layers is followed by:
  - **Batch Normalization**: Helps stabilize the learning process by normalizing the outputs.
  - **MaxPooling**: Reduces the size of the feature maps, keeping the most important information.
  - **Dropout**: Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping some of the connections during training.

- **Fully Connected Layers**: After the convolutional layers, I flattened the data and added fully connected layers to make sense of the learned features. The final layer uses softmax activation to output probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

## Training the Model

### Data Augmentation
To make the model more robust, I used data augmentation techniques like:
- **Rotation**: Rotating the images slightly.
- **Shifting**: Moving the images horizontally and vertically.
- **Flipping**: Flipping the images horizontally.

These techniques help the model generalize better by creating variations of the training data.

### Optimization
- I used the **Adam optimizer** because it’s efficient and works well for this kind of problem.
- The loss function I chose is **Categorical Crossentropy**, which is standard for multi-class classification.

### Callbacks
To get the best results, I set up:
- **ModelCheckpoint**: This saves the best version of the model during training based on validation loss.
- **EarlyStopping**: Stops the training early if the model isn’t improving, preventing overfitting.

## Evaluating the Model

Once the model was trained, I evaluated its performance using the test set. Here’s what I looked at:
- **Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Confusion Matrix**: A handy tool that shows where the model got things right and where it went wrong.
- **Classification Report**: This gives me precision, recall, and F1-score for each class, helping me understand the model’s strengths and weaknesses.

## Customizing the Project

If you want to tweak this project, here are some ideas:
- **Model Architecture**: Feel free to add more layers or try different types of layers like Residual Blocks or Attention mechanisms.
- **Hyperparameters**: You can experiment with different batch sizes, learning rates, and dropout rates to see if you can improve the model’s performance.
- **Data Augmentation**: Try adding other augmentation techniques like zooming, shearing, or brightness adjustments.
- **Transfer Learning**: If you’re interested in getting even better results, you could use a pre-trained model like VGG16 or ResNet.

## Future Ideas

This project is just the beginning! Here’s what I’m thinking of exploring next:
- **Object Detection**: Moving beyond classification to identify and locate objects within images.
- **Image Segmentation**: Classifying each pixel in the image, which is useful for things like medical imaging or autonomous driving.
- **Model Deployment**: I’d love to deploy this model as an API using Flask or TensorFlow Serving, so it can be used in real-time applications.
